{"question":"What is a novel coronavirus?","answer":"<p>A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/types.html\">coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans</a> and cause mild illness, like the common cold.</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/0"}
{"question":"Why is the disease being called coronavirus disease 2019, COVID-19?","answer":"<p>On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTedros/status/1227297754499764230\">announced</a> an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”.</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/1"}
{"question":"How does the virus spread?","answer":"<p>There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/2"}
{"question":"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be spread through food, including restaurant take out, refrigerated or frozen packaged food?","answer":"<p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/3"}
{"question":"Will warm weather stop the outbreak of COVID-19?","answer":"<p>COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-covid-spreads.html\">many affected geographic areas</a>.

{"question":"What is community spread?","answer":"<p>Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of COVID-19 associated with food. Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day use a tissue to cover your coughing or sneezing, and wash your hands after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/5"}
{"question":"Can mosquitoes or ticks spread the virus that causes COVID-19?","answer":"<p>It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/6"}
{"question":"How can I protect myself?","answer":"<p>Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

{"question":"Does CDC recommend the use of masks to prevent COVID-19?","answer":"<p>At this time, CDC has no data to suggest that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks.

{"question":"What should I do if I have had close contact with someone who has COVID-19?","answer":"<p>There is still a lot that is unknown about COVID-19 and how it spreads. Coronaviruses are thought to be spread most often by respiratory droplets. Although the virus can survive for a short period on some surfaces, it is unlikely to be spread from domestic or international mail, products or packaging. However, it may be possible that people can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.</p>","_type":"dict","_key":"467431/1/1/17"}

The need for donated blood is constant, and blood centers are open and in urgent need of donations. CDC encourages people who are well to continue to donate blood if they are able, even if they are practicing social distancing because of COVID-19.
