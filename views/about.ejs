The project aims at providing most efficient and effective usage of available medical facilities, without adding any extra burden to any specific unit(s). Not only does it provide data on number of beds and ventilators available, but also maps their utilization values.
                This makes it very convenient for the patient to decide on which hospital to choose. The web application is equipped with multiple features like looking for emergency services, dynamic routing, discovering medical units, and what not.</div>
