FDA staff are working around the clock to support development of  <a data-entity-substitution=\"canonical\" data-entity-type=\"node\" data-entity-uuid=\"8f180820-8778-4836-aed9-f85a9824a8ce\" href=\"/emergency-preparedness-and-response/about-mcmi/what-are-medical-countermeasures\" title=\"What are Medical Countermeasures?\">medical countermeasures</a> and are providing regulatory advice, guidance, and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal food supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products.</p>","_type":"dict"},{"question":"Q: What is an emergency use authorization and how is it being used to respond to COVID-19?","answer":"<p>A: In certain types of emergencies, the FDA can issue an emergency use authorization, or EUA, to provide more timely access to critical medical products that may help during the emergency when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternative options. The EUA process is different than full FDA approval, clearance, or licensing because the EUA standard requires significantly less data than otherwise would be required for approval, clearance, or licensing by the FDA. This enables the FDA to authorize the emergency use of medical products that meet the criteria for issuance within weeks rather than months to years. Under the EUA authority, the FDA evaluates requests for authorization very quickly using the evidence that is available, carefully balancing the risks and benefits of the product as we know them, in addition to evaluating other criteria. EUAs are in effect until the emergency declaration ends but can be revised or revoked as we evaluate the needs during the emergency, or as products meet the criteria to become approved, cleared, or licensed by the FDA. The <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iGkwaESsGBQ\">What is an EUA? video</a> provides a short summary of this information. </p>","_type":"dict"},{"question":"Q: How does COVID-19 spread?","answer":"<p>On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency involving COVID-19, and subsequently issued declarations justifying the use of EUAs for medical products to prevent, treat and diagnose COVID-19. To date, over 100 EUAs have been issued to allow emergency access to tests, medical devices, personal protective equipment and therapeutics. <a href=\"/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-legal-regulatory-and-policy-framework/emergency-use-authorization#covid19euas\">See the EUAs that have been issued for COVID-19</a>.</p>","_type":"dict"},{"question":"Q: How can I prevent COVID-19?","answer":"<p>A: COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person.
